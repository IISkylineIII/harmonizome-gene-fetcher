# Harmonizome Gene Data Fetcher

This Python script allows users to query gene-related data from the [Harmonizome API](https://maayanlab.cloud/Harmonizome/) â€” a collection of processed datasets about genes and proteins.

The script fetches data for a given gene name and prints the associated information returned from Harmonizome.

### API Used

- **Harmonizome API**: Developed by the Ma'ayan Lab, it provides gene and protein functional association data aggregated from multiple resources.

### Features

- Sends HTTP requests to the Harmonizome REST API.
- Retrieves gene data in JSON format.
- Handles HTTP errors gracefully.

### How It Works

The script contains two main functions:
```
- `read_from_url(url)`: Makes a GET request and returns parsed JSON data.
- `fetch_gene_by_name(gene_name)`: Constructs the appropriate URL using the gene name and calls `read_from_url`.

### Example Input

```
```python
gene_name = 'nanog'
gene_data = fetch_gene_by_name(gene_name)
print(gene_data)
```
### Requirements
* Python 3.x
* requests library
Install it using pip if not already installed:
pip install requests

### Applications

* This tool can be used for:
* Bioinformatics and systems biology, to fetch gene-level annotations.
* Automated data mining from public gene knowledge bases.
* Gene prioritization pipelines, where functional data needs to be aggregated.
* Educational purposes, for exploring the structure and use of RESTful APIs in genomics.
